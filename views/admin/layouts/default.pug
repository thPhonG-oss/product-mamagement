        //- So when you use #{title} in your Pug template, it's accessing the title property that was 
        //- passed in the render object. This is part of Pug's template engine functionality and 
        //- how it handles data passing between controllers and views.
        //- If you don't pass a title variable when rendering, #{title} would render as undefined or empty in the template.
